<p><small><i>[14 Jul 2020. Part of an ongoing essay on computation,
capitalism, and Covid-19.]</i></small></p>
<p>In 1982, in a small suburb outside of Pittsburgh, the first known
computer virus was seen in the wild. Spread by floppy disk, ‘Elk
Cloner’, as the virus called itself, broke out in a community of early
computer gamers centered around the local high school. But the virus
soon began to infect people outside the community, reaching teachers’
instructional computers and eventually escaping to circulate in the
Pittsburgh area for years. News of the outbreak soon reached
<em>Scientific American</em> and <em>Time Magazine</em>, becoming the
first ‘virus’ to be nationally reported.</p>
<p>The virus was simple and clever. If an infected disk were inserted
into an Apple II computer (then popular with gamers for its color
screen), the virus would copy itself to the machine’s core memory, or
‘boot sector’. Then, it did nothing. Incubating and infectious, it lay
in wait for other disks to be inserted; then, it would silently copy
itself onto them, too. If one of these newly infected disks were
inserted into another computer, the process would begin anew inside a
new ‘host’ machine. Only on the fiftieth reboot of an infected computer
would the virus reveal itself, causing its one and only
‘symptom’—blanking the screen and printing the following few lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elk Cloner:<br />
The program with a personality</p>
<p>It will get on all your disks<br />
  It will infiltrate your chips<br />
    Yes, it’s Cloner!</p>
<p>It will stick to you like glue<br />
  It will modify RAM too<br />
    Send in the Cloner!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was all just a prank—and a poetic one at that. Programmed by a
15-year-old high schooler, Elk Cloner was Richard Skrenta’s masterpiece
of petty revenge. A well-known trickster in the local video game
community, Richard Skrenta had already acquired a reputation for
sneaking disruptive code onto the floppy disk copies of games which
others received back from him. Friends began to stop sharing games with
him, and Skrenta—perhaps an early example of that perverse blend of Ken
Kesey and Ayn Rand so distinctive of Silicon Valley and early computing
culture—plotted revenge. But how, he asked himself, could he continue to
get his code onto his friends’ computers, without having direct,
tangible access to their disk drives?</p>
<p>The eventual form of that solution in a ‘virus’, spreading from
computer to computer in the open air through floppy disks, was
unprecedented. It alarmed experts in the nascent computer security
industry, who until then were familiar primarily with ‘worms,’ ‘Trojan
horses,’ and ‘logic bombs’: non-replicating programs which infiltrated a
single computer or mainframe, typically wiping its data or clogging its
memory. On April 15th, 1985, for instance, a ‘logic bomb’ detonated in
the IBM mainframe of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power
(DWP), freezing access to its files and grinding work to a halt. When
the DWP took the unusual step of calling the police, which had
established a cybersecurity division only a month earlier, twenty
experts arrived to repair the sabotage, taking a week to bring the
system back online; the suspect, likely an employee, was never
apprehended.</p>
<p>A rising problem for industry, cybercrime afflicted about a quarter
of Fortune 500 companies in the 1980s, bleeding about $750 million in
damages. Before the rise of the Internet, which connected the various,
generally exclusively academic or military networks like ARPAnet,
MILnet, R&amp;Dnet, Usenet, and Bitnet, ‘hacking’ computers remotely via
digital networks was rare, confined to dialing by modem directly into an
institution’s private network. ‘Worms’ and ‘bombs’ placed in the
computers from the inside were much more common. In 1982, for instance,
the same year as the Elk Cloner virus, a logic bomb was discovered in
the computer systems of Collins Foods International Inc., operator of
more than 200 Sizzler and Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants across the
U.S. and Australia. Although never detonated, the bomb was discovered
buried in the firm’s code by another programmer and reported to the
police; Dennis Williams, a 33-year-old disgruntled programmer at the
firm, was later arrested and convicted of new statutes against
cybercrime. In the trial, the L.A. Deputy District Attorney charged
Williams of planting the logic bomb because he was ‘dissatisfied with
the company and in particular, one employee, a supervisor.’ Such attacks
were in fact often made by disgruntled programmers fed up with poor
working conditions—auguring the first wave of casualized employment in
the computer industry, about which more below.</p>
<p>A cybersecurity concept of the ‘virus’, attacking not by direct
sabotage but through indirect contamination, did not therefore fully
consolidate until as late as 1987, when the first conference on
‘artificial life’ was held at the Los Alamos National Laboratory—the
site of the infamous Manhattan Project and of a number of early
computing advances, including that of self-replicating programs or
‘automata’. As Jussi Paraka writes in <em>Digital Contagions</em>,
self-replicating programs therefore have a longer history (discussed
further below), with ‘more widespread roots in … modernity than the
security-oriented notion a computer virus implies.’ But in the 1980s,
the closer, more explicit context for understanding the emergence of a
computer ‘virus’ was not in fact these military-academic roots, but
rather the far more immediate crisis of the ongoing AIDS epidemic. In
1981, a year before the first computer virus was discovered, the HIV
virus began to emerge in the gay communities of New York, Los Angeles,
and San Francisco. ‘Last week there were rumors that an exotic new
disease had hit the gay community in New York,’ wrote Dr. Lawrence Mass,
infamously, on May 18th in the <em>New York Native</em>. San Francisco,
whose <em>Chronicle</em> was praised for its accurate reporting on
computer viruses and worms, was home, at the same time, to the very
different kind of viral epidemic of HIV.</p>
<p>Computer viruses therefore arose historically alongside biological
viruses, becoming legible only against the backdrop of the spread of
HIV. ‘Computer AIDS’, ‘digital hygiene’, ‘safe hex’ were all phrases
used to understand the possible dangers of a new computer epidemic. One
1990 article commented on the metaphorical conjunction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like the AIDS virus, the computer ‘virus’ attacked the ‘immune
systems’ of the computers it invaded. Like AIDS, the computer ‘virus’
spread through exchanges between between individuals. Instead of body
fluids being exchanged through sex, it was software exchanged by
electronic mail. … In both cases, the entire society proved to be at
risk because of the actions of a subculture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both epidemics occurred on the fringes of normative society,
initially ‘invisible’ through their unfamiliarity (computer culture) or
social repression (HIV). Both involved intimate and, to many,
frightening forms of vulnerability—disk copying, homosexual sex—which,
formerly secluded in a corner of the social landscape, suddenly seemed
to threaten the rest of society through their interconnectedness with
the totality of social exchanges and relations.</p>
<p>A virus must therefore be understood as primarily a social
relationship. Transcending the medium of its transmission, whether data
transfer or sexual contact, the emergence of any virus reveals the
network of social relations that is its true ‘body’ and the true medium
through which it moves. In April of this year, as Boris Johnson lay ill
with Covid-19, he felt compelled to correct the infamous assertion of
Margaret Thatcher: ‘there really is such a thing as society’, he said
from a video message sent from self-isolation. Even for Johnson, a Tory
invested in the primacy of individual liberty, a virus makes plain the
networks of transmission and circulation out of which ‘society’—for
Thatcher, an imaginary abstraction—is, in fact, terrifyingly real.</p>
<p>The arrival of Covid-19 has made this more apparent than ever, just
as the prevalence of 5G conspiracy theories—some of which claim that 5G
radio waves directly transmit the virus—show that the social imaginary
of the virus continues to blend biological and computerized notions of
disease. Covid-19 also shows that quasi-racialized fears of
globalization (centering on Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications company
and the manufacturer of 5G cellphone towers) underlie both imaginaries,
with the U.S. President Donald Trump continuing to call the coronavirus
the ‘China virus’. Finally, as will be explored below, the initial
formalization of self-replicating ‘automata’ in 1953 preceded by only a
few months the discovery of DNA, which itself was explicitly understood
in relation to computer code. A biological virus, in this sense, was
itself a rogue program, a set of copying instructions designed through
natural selection to replicate itself efficiently. More than simply a
convenient metaphor or analogy, then, the conceptual and cultural
overlap between computer and biological viruses like Covid-19 reveals
something about the sociology of viruses, computers, and, as I will
argue, the current computational regime of capital accumulation, which
neither alone could show.</p>
