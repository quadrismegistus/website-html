<h2 id="immaterially-stuck">1. Immaterially stuck</h2>
<p>I am writing these paragraphs while stuck in my apartment; presumably
you are reading them while stuck in yours. This literal sense of being
‘stuck’, of physically being unable to move, is probably not the one
intended in the upcoming <a
href="https://reenlightening.org/rex8/">Re:Enlightenment exchange on
‘Getting Unstuck’</a>. In the statements already gathered here,
‘stuckness’ is theorized more abstractly, as a condition of knowledge
(<a href="https://reenlightening.org/rex8/?p=963">Siskin</a>), our
conceptual architectures (<a
href="https://reenlightening.org/rex8/?p=832">de Bolla</a>), our ideas
about free speech (<a
href="https://reenlightening.org/rex8/?p=998">Warner</a>),
social-scientific instrumentalization (<a
href="https://reenlightening.org/rex8/?p=932">Drucker</a>) or epistemic
bubbles (<a href="https://reenlightening.org/rex8/?p=978">Rudy</a>). To
get unstuck, then, involves re-designing (also a theme of the event)
those abstract forms: concepts, ideas, models of human behavior. At the
same time, it seems worth adding to these reflections on epistemological
or disciplinary stuckness our more basic, immediate, tangible experience
of being stuck, of being unable to move outside our homes, congregate,
meet, or touch. This situation is, as we know, historically
unprecedented. One third of the world’s population (a staggering 2.5
billion people) lives under some form of lockdown, compelled to remain
indoors, immobilized and isolated—in a word, stuck.</p>
<p>But what kind of stuckness is this? Is it different from the
stuckness of knowledge or ideas? As a word, ‘stuckness’ succeeds in part
through its plainness, elevating an old, rough, Anglo-Saxon word to the
level of a modern abstraction. From the Old English, the adjective
referred to a ‘stuck’ or ‘sticked’ pig with ‘a knife thrust into its
neck’; not until 1865 does it mean tangibly ‘held fast or trapped,’ and
not until 1913 ‘unable to progress or develop’.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>It
is interesting to note that stuckness, the keyword with which we
investigate such abstract concerns as progress and knowledge, originated
in something so sinewy and tangible as the stabbing of a pig. This
semantic tension, in fact, between a visceral concreteness with an
analytic abstractness, may be what makes stuckness a particularly useful
keyword with which to examine a broad network of restraints and
blockages in our social and material lives—and not only in our academic
ones.</p>
<p>After all, an entangled <em>totality</em> of blockages seems to be
what we are experiencing at the moment. If we are now stuck in our
homes, for example, what really has us ‘held fast’? No mere ‘mugger’, as
in Boris Johnson’s bizarre metaphor for the waves of mass death coursing
through the UK and the world. Rather, we face a more distant and
intangible restraint—and not only the so-called ‘invisible enemy’ of the
virus. The true invisible threat is not the virus itself but the global
networks of exchange, circulation, and accumulation through which the
virus grows and spreads at exponential speeds. Like a runaway train
without a driver, the virus is just a mindless machine barreling down
the tracks it’s given; and it’s currently screeching its way along the
weary, broken infrastructure of a world long rewired and globalized by
the invisible, abstract logic of capital.</p>
<p>What has us all stuck like a pig is not so much the virus, in other
words, as this <em>viral medium</em>: not the train but the railway
system, the entire social and material organization which is the true
‘body’ of the virus and the real medium through which it spreads. The
virus began, let us not forget, as a commodity on the (‘wet’) market: in
the bats, pangolins, and other wild animals dislocated from their
habitats and sold together in tight spaces congregating bacterial and
viral matter from around the world. In this sense, the biological
processes which gave birth to the coronavirus cannot be separated from
the spatial and economic processes which brought together its viral
ingredients. Like a bio-luminescent fluid swallowed to light up the
inside of an organ, the virus reveals, as it spreads, the inner shape
and contours of the global system. What it shows is less merely
interconnectedness of local and global scales than a total collapse of
scale itself, as if local conditions were less the distant, downstream
effect of the global economy than its direct, physical embodiment, and
capitalism itself were coughing through our lungs.</p>
<p>Our being tangibly stuck in our homes is therefore not only related
to more distant and abstract forms of stuckness (even in our knowledge
or ideas) but dialectically inseparable from them. Our stuckness in
epistemic bubbles is inseparable from our stuckness in a digitalized
capitalism powered by machine learning algorithms; our stuckness in an
instrumental or over-dissective (<a
href="https://reenlightening.org/rex8/?p=985">Bowker</a>) research
framework is inseparable from the broader forces of rationalization
which have evolved historically with the world capitalist system. What
the virus may show us in the Re:Enlightenment in particular, then, is
that we may need a more <em>Gestalt</em> approach to stuckness, one
which examines it as a condition of the social totality and not only as
an independent blockage of certain academic or intellectual systems.</p>
<h2 id="we-the-cognitariat">2. We the cognitariat</h2>
<p>But stuckness, at the moment, is a privilege. Which of us now is even
able to be stuck, to stay indoors and avoid exposure to this deadly and
contagious disease? Primarily, besides those unfortunate enough to be
unemployed or laid off, that class of workers who can ‘work from home’:
the rest we cynically call ‘key’ or ‘essential’ workers and thrust
outside into harm’s way. At the moment, in near-total lockdown, with
nearly all businesses shuttered to the public and the streets uncannily
empty, we may as well call the brave delivery workers the ‘stalkers’ of
our age, after of course the unnamed protagonist of Tarkovsky’s 1979
film who makes a living guiding members of the wealthier professional
classes (in the named simply ‘Writer’ and ‘Professor’) through the
deserted overgrown urban wasteland called ‘The Zone.’ The world outside
our homes has, for now, become a kind of ‘Zone’, revealing an already
existing class of stalkers, the elite paratroopers of an otherwise the
gig economy, carrying Deliveroo and Uber Eats orders on their backs
through the irradiated near-empty streets.</p>
<p>But what of these workers who work from home? What exactly do they
do? What kind of labor is able to undergo this spatial dislocation? To
answer that question we can turn to a body of literature that has been
thinking through changes in the labor process since the 1970s toward the
‘postindustrial’ economy: changes which, by their account, have elevated
the so-called ‘immaterial’ or ‘cognitive’ components of labor. Much of
this literature (Maurizio Lazzarato, Yann Moulier Boutang, Ursula Huws,
Dick Dyer-Witheford, Christian Fuchs, Mackenzie Wark) is influenced by
the Italian ‘workerism’ (<em>operaismo</em>) movement of the 1950s,
itself inspired by Marx’s remarks, in the ‘Fragment on Machines’ in the
<em>Grundrisse</em>, on the ‘general intellect’ of the workers (their
knowledge and know-how) as somehow embodied in their machines and itself
valued component of the labor process. What, these writers ask, is this
intellective or cognitive content of labor, and what is its history over
the last several decades?</p>
<p>In <em>Cognitive Capitalism</em>, for instance, Boutang (following
Lazzarato) proposes that since the 1970s a new regime of ‘immaterial’
labor has consolidated: a ‘cognitive’ labor performed by the new
‘cognitariat.’ Such a class includes everyone from call center workers
to computer programmers, casualized culture workers, educators and
academics: everyone whose labor depends mainly on a ‘brain … equipped
and extended by networked computers.’<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The ‘collective
cognitive labor power’ such a network of cognitiariats forms is, for
Boutang, sufficiently distinct from the ‘muscle-power consumed by
machines’ of the proletariat that it constitutes a new mode of
production and form of labor. Even, for example, in the oldest,
‘primary,’ prototypically manual-labor industry of the economy,
agriculture, the cognitive dimensions of labor have risen in importance
and value, with the industry’s heavy investments in chemical fertilizer
research, genetic engineering, automation, patents, and complex
advertising and certification processes. ‘The increasingly immaterial
character of capitalism’ can be seen in these developments, writes
Razmig Keucheyan: ‘the importance of knowledge-value is in this sense
increasing and that of labour-value as traditionally conceived –
measured by labour time – is tending to decline.’<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Of course, such theories of a new immaterial labor face a predictable
materialist critique: that all forms of labor, however digital or
cognitive, are ineluctably material, ultimately grounded in material
things and practices. On a theoretical level, however, such a critique
fails to understand that the point of isolating an ‘immaterial’
component of labor is precisely in order to build a materialism adequate
to the digital and postindustrial age. We need, in a nice turn of phrase
from Boutang, to bring our Marx from Manchester to California. A
materialist analysis of the internet, for instance, cannot simply
‘expose’ the thingly basis of its infrastructure, pointing to the thick
wires it travels through at the bottom of the world’s oceans; it must
also contend with the fact that the speed and shape of such wires have
nevertheless effectively ‘dematerialized’ our work and social life,
abstracting away our physical distances and disembedding and rerouting
our social relations.</p>
<p>But never mind all that. The virus has, in a way, already nullified
these theoretical questions, providing a brutally qualitative
measurement of the relative ‘immateriality’ of one’s labor: either it
requires you to expose your material body to the world, risking
infection from a fatal virus, or it doesn’t, in which case it allows you
to work from the comfort and safety of your own home, sipping coffee and
lightly typing on your laptop. Sure, ‘Zoomable’ was not exactly what
Lazzarato meant by ‘immaterial’ labor, nor ‘worker from home’ what
Boutang meant by the cognitariat. We can and should debate the vagaries
of meaning in these concepts, and of how they relate to others
(precariat, information worker, and so on). But whatever we call these
apparently new forms of labor and class divisions, the important point
is that such divisions in the structure of labor were neither created by
nor imposed on us by the virus, but have rather been developing for
decades through a set of related ‘dematerializing’ transformations in
the postindustrial economy.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the post-70s turn from the tangible to the
intangible asset. In 1975, ‘tangible assets’ like land, property,
machinery and equipment made up 83% of the total market value of the
S&amp;P 500; by 2015, the reverse was true, with 84% of market value
taken up by ‘intangible assets’ like data, software, and intellectual
property.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> In 2004, Allen Greenspan remarked
that this ‘shift of emphasis from physical materials to ideas as the
core of value creation appears to have accelerated in recent decades.’<a
href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Talk of a ‘cognitive capitalism’ is
meant to mark out these fundamental changes in economy, and theorize how
a new ‘object of accumulation’ which ‘consists mainly of
<em>knowledge</em>, which becomes the basic source of value, as well as
the principal location of the process of valorisation.’<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>But these changes in the ‘tangibility’ of assets on the commodities
market do not even include the rise of newly abstract financial
instruments: finance being, as Fredric Jameson puts it, a ‘second-level
abstraction’ to the first-order one of money, prices, or
exchange-value.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Derivatives, for instance, which are
effectively bets on the future prices of assets, and so also
‘dematerialized’ to the extent that they ‘are totally shorn of the
characteristics of the assets concerned’, ballooned over this period:
negligible in total value in the early 1970s, they skyrocketed in value
to $865 billion in 1987 and $685 trillion in the 2000s, orders of
magnitude more than than the entire U.S. GDP.<a href="#fn8"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> For
Cédric Durand, from whom I take these numbers, such changes constitute a
new regime of ‘<em>fictitious</em> capital,’ or ‘incarnation of that
capital which tends to free itself from the process of
valorisation-through-production’: production, of <em>any</em> kind,
however tangible or intangible.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Simultaneous with such financialization came the so-called
‘deindustrialization’ of nations like the United States: manufacturing
employment fell 64% over the last 50 years, from 22% of all US workers
in 1970 to 8% in 2017. Similar numbers occur across other high-income
nations: over the same period, employment in the sector fell from 30% to
8% in the UK (-74%), 23% to 9% in France (-61%), 29% to 17% in Germany
(-41%), and 25% to 15% in both Japan and Italy (-40%).<a href="#fn10"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>
As Aaron Benenav has recently shown, these changes in manufacturing
employment were less the result of automation advances (a thesis
recently popularized by U.S. presidential candidate Andrew Yang) than
the ‘industrial overcapacity spread around the world’ as large
automakers stretched production across global supply chains. Lowering
operating costs to 10-20% those of mid-century heights.<a href="#fn11"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>As
Giovanni Arrighi writes, the process of deindustrialization can
therefore more accurately be called a ‘reterritorialization’ of global
industrial space. In fact, for Arrighi, such reterritorialization lies
at the heart of capitalist development, as the long, uneven struggle
plays out between ‘territorialist’ forces concentrated in the state and
‘deterritorial’ forces concentrated in capital.<a href="#fn12"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>Contemporary globalization, then,
marks only the latest stage of the deterritorialization of social and
material space, a centuries-long rearrangement and subordination of
concrete logics of proximity and locality to abstract logics of capital
and profit.</p>
<p>Today, such dislocations of especially ‘cognitive’ labor are, of
course, largely made possible by new developments of computing
technology: from the advent of business computing in the 1970s, the
personal computer in the 1980s, and the construction of the
instantaneous worldwide communication infrastructure of the internet in
the 1990s. We must keep in mind that these relatively new technological
developments were themselves driven by the forces of dematerialization
in the global economy listed above. At the same time, it cannot be
denied that the rise of networked computing and the transformation of
all information into digital form constitutes perhaps the most direct
effect on the dematerialization of labor over the last few decades. As
the materials and outputs of one’s labor are all digitalized, and so
instantaneously communicable from anywhere in the world through globally
networked computers, the long-standing constraints of time and space to
the labor process are increasingly annihilated. The means of production
have become increasingly abstracted or distanced from the place of
production.</p>
<p>Our new ‘virtual turn,’ then, to Zoom, online teaching, working from
home (‘WFH’), is not a new event forced on us by the virus but the final
triumph of a long ‘dematerialization’ of value and the labor process. It
is no mere novelty, then, an experience of the ‘latest technology,’ to
teach bored students over Zoom: we have been preparing, and many of us
already occupying, the subject position of the disembodied laborer for
decades. Nor, for that matter, is it now a novelty to use Zoom for
everything from online classes to online happy hours (or even, according
to Twitter, to orgies): isn’t that just the expression, at the level of
our software use, of the decades-long dissolution of the boundary
between ‘work’ and ‘life’ within ‘cognitive capitalism’?</p>
<p>On a personal note, many folks I know say things haven’t really
changed for them: they already work from home, they already prefer a
quiet social life, etc. In a way I’m no different, a pampered postdoc,
working from home. At the same time, I have to confess that I feel a
little disturbed by my and everyone’s capacity, though maybe especially
us academics, to keep calm and carry on in our cognitariat grunt work as
hundreds of thousands of people die around us and tens of millions lose
their jobs in an economic crisis worse than the Great Depression. In the
midst, many of us are still worried about our productivity levels.
Perhaps, in the end, the most shocking fact of this crisis will be how
<em>little</em> it changes. Not even a global pandemic scouring the
entire surface of the globe is sufficient to change the work habits of
the cognitariat or the labor process of the new cognitive capitalism.
And if that’s not proof of the new regime of immaterial labor, what
is?</p>
<h2 id="back-to-the-virtual">3. Back to the virtual?</h2>
<p>Does this mean we are stuck? Are we now ‘stuck’ in cyberspace: the
online world, Zoom, online teaching? For one thing, suddenly the concept
of ‘stuckness’ doesn’t seem to make as much sense, as if cyberspace has
too many dimensions to get stuck ‘in’ or ‘out’ of it. In that sense,
what may be least productive as a response to the present situation is
to slam on the reverse, to try to get un-stuck by turning around,
forcing our way out. There may be no ‘reverse.’ Like the lockdown
protesters, we want to get unstuck from the quarantine; unfortunately,
though, the only way to get unstuck may be to stick it out even longer.
If, for instance, we as humanists fail to articulate what it is that our
students miss in an online education beside the usual, already tired
arguments about the importance of the humanities and liberal arts—if
all, in other words, we can offer is antithesis and attempts at
rhetorical persuasion, holding just a candle of opposition to the
inexorable forces of the last few decades, then are we really any better
than the lockdown protesters? Are we offering anything but a death-cult
conservatism?</p>
<p>The challenge we face now is like that of a patient of Carl Jung’s
who described a dream in which she was drowning as Jung happened to walk
by, but rather than help her, he pushed her further underwater with his
cane, saying: ‘not out, but through.’ What if to get unstuck we need to
get <em>more</em> stuck? What would it mean, for instance, to
<em>embrace</em> or even accelerate our virtual fate together? How, in
our jaded, post-truth, alt-right era of online culture, can we learn to
love the internet again, to get excited about its ‘virtual’
possibilities, like we did in the cyberpunk ’90s or the Wikipedian
2000s? Without succumbing to nostalgia, how might we rewind the clock on
computational culture just long enough to remember the historical
framework within which the ‘virtual’ was first apprehended and
theorized, and which might allow us to re-imagine (re-design,
re-enlighten) our present ‘stuckness’ in cyberspace?</p>
<p>Somehow, in the ’80s and ’90s, things may have been clearer. The
ethics of virtuality were darker but subtler then than our current
cheerful neoliberal abandon. In <em>Blade Runner</em> (1982),
<em>Neuromancer</em> (1984), <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> (1995), or
<em>The Matrix</em> (1999), one can always feel, in one and same moment,
the potential transcendence of the virtual as well as the dark
realization that any such transcendence would be mediated by the very
globalized, multinational forces of informatic control from which one is
trying to escape. Although for us the social spaces and flows of
internet life have long since normalized, the ’80s and ’90s were somehow
better able to remember and sustain this underlying contradiction: that
a liberatory, cybernetic sublime (like Donna Haraway’s feminist ‘Cyborg
Manifesto’ [1985] or Mackenzie Wark’s <em>Hacker Manifesto</em> [2004])
might somehow nevertheless be built on the bathetic, material basis of
that infrastructure in globalized capitalism.</p>
<p>As we now wonder for how long may be ‘stuck’ in the virtual world,
what the early, ‘cyberpunk’ formation of digital culture may have most
to offer us is its insistence on imagining that virtual ‘world’ <em>as a
world</em>: not as a form of ‘media’ like social media, nor as a VR
simulacrum of a physical space, but instead as a wholly new kind of
space itself, an abstract, digital space which has its own properties
and distinctive phenomenology. The archetypal example of this concept is
of course William Gibson’s invention of ‘cyberspace’ in the 1984 Ur-text
of cyberpunk fiction, <em>Neuromancer.</em> When for example its
hacker-protagonist Case, the foundational ‘console cowboy’ of the genre,
is finally able to ‘jack’ into the matrix once more, he feels a euphoric
rush as the ‘dead meat’ of his body slides away, and he enters</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions
of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught
mathematical concepts … A graphic representation of data abstracted from
the banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity.
Lines of light ranged in the non-space of the mind, clusters and
constellations of data.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The experience of this cyberspace is equally sensual, ecstatic, and
psychedelic as it is cold, digital, and abstract. It is a space into
which both children and banks enter as ‘legitimate operators.’
Cinematically, grids and ‘lines of light’, architecture and
‘constellations of data’, and ‘constellations of data’ call to mind the
film <em>Tron</em> (1982) of the same era.</p>

alt="img" /><small>Still from <em>Tron</em> (1982), directed by Donald
Kushner</small></p>
<p>In contrast to the massive, fantastic monstrosities of the superhero
genre dominant over the last two decades, <em>Tron</em> uses digital
cinematic magic to render an abstract, colorless, lifeless,
dematerialized space—a difference which cannot be explained by mere
technological improvements. What, then, encourages such an abstract
cyberspace to emerge aesthetically at this time?</p>
<p>Indeed, cyberspace is a peculiar kind of space. ‘It is not really
visual,’ as Jameson notes, but abstract: ‘it is as it were the
architectural <em>plan</em> of a city rather than the city itself; … it
is already an abstraction, and as it were the very specific language or
code of an abstraction, just as numbers and mathematical symbols are
another such code.’ It is even, like finance, an ‘an abstraction to the
second power’: ‘The initial metaphor of a city for an information
network is a first-level abstraction; then the representation
<em>of</em> that city by the abstractions of the architects raises it to
a second power.’<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> The invention of cyberspace, then,
and its rendering of a non-visual, abstract and non-physical spatiality,
would seem to acknowledge the arrival of the new regime of abstraction
and dematerialization which, as we also saw seen above, consolidated
over the last several decades within our social, economic, and cultural
life. The arrival of cyberspace therefore coincides with that of
financialization, which also brought with it new speculative spaces
defined entirely by data, numbers, and values dislocated from an
underlying material nature.</p>
<p>But somewhere in the 2000s or 2010s we seem to have stopped imagining
this spatiality to the internet and the virtual ‘world’. Gone or fading
are its spatial metaphors like ‘surfing’ the ‘web,’ the ‘net’, ‘the
‘information superhighway’, the ‘matrix’, not to mention ‘cyberspace’
itself. After all, it all turned out so much more mundane. We’re not
hacking away at the protective ICE of the global system; we just
‘scroll,’ endlessly scroll, on 1-5 websites which are maintained by 1-3
of the world’s largest corporations. Perhaps the truth is that we’ve so
interfused with the matrix that it becomes impossible to imagine a
dialing or ‘jacking’ into it, to imagine a true spatial transfer between
‘in’ and ‘out’. But with Covid-19 locking us all away, this may now be
changing, which is partly why a return to theories of virtual
<em>space</em> may be newly relevant: I’ve now ‘been,’ for example, to
Club Quarantäne ‘in’ Berlin, which streams DJs from their apartments for
36 hours but does so in a corny, abstract simulacrum of a Berlin club,
allowing you to move between ‘rooms’, including a bar (offering the sale
of charity donations) and a bathroom, which is a chatroom that usually
having A/S/L-style dirty conversations.</p>
<p>But in general, if we can’t or don’t anymore imagine an ‘inside’ to
the virtual, does this then preclude the possibility of our hacking into
it, and changing it from the inside? For Gibson and the cyberpunks, the
abstract dimensions of cyberspace made possible a new kind of subversive
agency which would allow human agency to respatialize and confront the
abstract forces of corporations and systems on their own terms. But is
this subversive potential of the ‘virtual’ still possible any longer? Is
it still possible to imagine, as the ’90s did, not scorning or
abandoning the matrix, but re-entering it with a new, focused, creative
self-awareness, and rebuilding within it the world we want to see?</p>
<p>Maybe not. On the other hand, perhaps we need a new concept of
‘cyberspace’ to do so, one a bit less retro and with a bit less an
emphasis on computing. Things are just more complicated now. The
prevalence of 5G conspiracy theories alleging that the coronavirus
spread like data over the internet should show us that notions of
computer and human viruses have already too deeply interfused, just as
have the notions of cyber- and social space. ‘Virality’, after all, is
now a well-understood, even a mundane phenomenon in our social media
lives, a fact which made all the more puzzling how incapable the West
was in early March to comprehend how exponentially the virus would
spread. Virality, as we can see now, is a condition of nearly every
aspect of our social and economic lives. Tweets, posts, fake news,
computer viruses, human viruses, coronaviruses, commodities, financial
transactions, data—all are whisked across a vast, globalized web of
multifaceted relationships so quickly and so thoroughly as to become, in
effect, an instantaneous whole and a kind of viral ‘space’ to its own.
Indeed, perhaps the notion of cyberspace we need is precisely this
<em>viralspace,</em> this multidimensional, interconnected,
dialectically inseparable mass of social, material, digital, biological,
and intellectual relations: a new concept of the ‘totality,’ perhaps,
redesigned for the viral age. Are we stuck here? Maybe. If so, and this
is a sincere question: should we try to get ‘out’, or should we try to
move ‘through’?</p>

<li id="fn12" role="doc-endnote"><p>As Arrighi outlines it, this long
struggle between territorial and deterritorial forces passes through
four cycles of accumulation typified according by their geographic
centers: from Venice, an isolated city-state able to combine territorial
and deterritorializing forces of the state and trade; to Amsterdam,
whose state power was built from dominating the seas and European trade
routes; to London, which built the largest empire in the history of the
world, a vast territory concentrated by the de-territorialized logic of
capital into the hands of a tiny island in the Atlantic ocean; to New
York, which perfected the multinational corporation and transferred even
the territorial powers of the state to the logic of capital and the
company—including not only how factories are built but how cities are
run (as in, for example, the eventual financial takeover of New York’s
city management in the 1970s).<a href="#fnref12" class="footnote-back"
